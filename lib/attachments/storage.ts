/**
 * lib/attachments/storage — traversal-proof attachment persistence
 * (ATCH-03 / T-07-01 / T-07-02).
 *
 * The ONLY module that writes uploaded attachment bytes to disk. It mirrors
 * `lib/csv/storage.ts` (env-path resolver → mkdirSync → write) and shares the
 * SAME `UPLOADS_PATH` volume (CONTEXT decision), so uploads are configured in
 * exactly one place.
 *
 * SECURITY (ATCH-03 / T-07-01): the on-disk file is named from
 * `crypto.randomUUID()` with a FIXED `.bin` extension — the user-supplied
 * filename and its original extension are NEVER trusted into the path, so a name
 * like `../../etc/passwd` can never become a path component. The original
 * filename is kept in the DB (attachments.filename) for matching + display only.
 *
 * The returned `storagePath` is the RELATIVE `<uuid>.bin`; callers resolve it
 * against UPLOADS_DIR at read time (Pitfall 4 — absolute paths don't survive the
 * dev→container boundary).
 *
 * Unlike the CSV reader, the worker forwards the resolved ABSOLUTE path straight
 * to nodemailer's `attachments: [{ path }]` and never reads bytes into memory —
 * so this module exposes `resolveAttachmentPath` (returns the path) +
 * `attachmentExists` (presence check) rather than a byte reader.
